# Performance Monitoring Implementation Progress

## Completed Components

### 1. Real-time Metrics Service
- Location: `//wsl$/ubuntu/home/jamesdavidwest/backend-boiler/src/services/RealTimeMetricsService.js`
- Handles collection of system, application, and database metrics
- Implements event emission for real-time updates
- Includes configurable collection intervals
- Built-in analysis for performance issues

### 2. WebSocket Service
- Location: `//wsl$/ubuntu/home/jamesdavidwest/backend-boiler/src/services/MetricsWebSocketService.js`
- Manages real-time connections for metrics delivery
- Handles client subscriptions and message routing
- Includes connection status monitoring
- Supports selective metric subscriptions

### 3. Metrics API Routes
- Location: `//wsl$/ubuntu/home/jamesdavidwest/backend-boiler/src/routes/api/metrics.routes.js`
- REST endpoints for metrics data retrieval
- Authentication and authorization integration
- Swagger documentation completed
- Configuration management endpoints

### 4. Dashboard Components
- Base Location: `//wsl$/ubuntu/home/jamesdavidwest/backend-boiler/src/components/dashboard/`
- Main Component: `MetricsDashboard.jsx`
- Real-time metrics visualization
- System, application, and database metric cards
- Performance and resource usage charts
- Recent events display

### 5. Documentation
- Comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Detailed endpoint specifications
- Request/response examples
- Security schemes documented
- WebSocket integration documentation

## Next Steps

### 1. WebSocket Connection Management
- Create WebSocket wrapper utility
- Add reconnection logic
- Implement connection status monitoring
- Add message queuing for offline periods

### 2. Alert Notification System
- Create alert configuration UI
- Implement alert triggers
- Add notification delivery system
- Create alert history viewer

### 3. Metrics History
- Implement metrics storage
- Create history viewer component
- Add data export functionality
- Implement trend analysis

### 4. Testing
- Write integration tests for WebSocket service
- Create dashboard component tests
- Add metrics collection accuracy tests
- Implement performance benchmarks

## Directory Structure
The project is located in a WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment:
```
//wsl$/ubuntu/home/jamesdavidwest/backend-boiler/
```

Important paths for next steps:
```
/src
  /components
    /dashboard
      MetricsDashboard.jsx
      [Future] AlertConfig.jsx
      [Future] MetricsHistory.jsx
  /services
    RealTimeMetricsService.js
    MetricsWebSocketService.js
  /routes
    /api
      metrics.routes.js
      performance.routes.js
  /utils
    [Future] websocket.js
    [Future] alertManager.js
  /config
    swagger.js
  /schemas
    api.schemas.js
  /docs
    /api
      openapi.json
      index.html
```

## Current State
- Core metrics collection infrastructure is operational
- Real-time delivery system is in place
- Basic dashboard visualization is implemented
- REST API endpoints are ready
- Integration with existing authentication is complete
- Documentation system is fully implemented
- OpenAPI/Swagger specs are complete

## Next Chat Focus
The next implementation session should focus on either:
1. WebSocket connection management utilities
2. Alert notification system
3. Metrics history viewer

Priority recommendation: Start with WebSocket connection management as it's fundamental to the reliability of the real-time updates.

## Recent Updates (December 14, 2024)
- Completed comprehensive API documentation
- Added security endpoint documentation
- Implemented performance monitoring endpoint documentation
- Updated Swagger configuration
- Created documentation generation and serving scripts
- Added WebSocket message schemas
- Documented real-time metrics streaming endpoints

## Notes
- Documentation is now fully integrated with the existing codebase
- API testing can be done through Swagger UI
- Security schemes (JWT and API Key) are properly documented
- Real-time WebSocket connection details are documented
- Performance monitoring configuration endpoints are ready
